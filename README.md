## Model Approaches (User Playtime based Collobrative Filtering using BPR + Content Filtering using LDA + Clustering using Cosine-Similarity)

### What is Model Approaches?
Our Steam games recommendation system implements collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and clustering techniques to test their efficacy in providing accurate and personalized game suggestions. Collaborative filtering analyzes user playtime and interactions to recommend games enjoyed by similar users. Content-based filtering suggests games with similar attributes to those a user has previously enjoyed. Clustering techniques group users and games based on behaviors and attributes to uncover hidden trends and enhance recommendations. By evaluating these methods separately, we aim to understand their strengths and limitations before integrating them into a future hybrid model for even better recommendations.
